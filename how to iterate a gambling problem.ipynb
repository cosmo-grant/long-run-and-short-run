    "We generate a vertical or horizontal gambling problem by iterating a one-off gambling problem. Iterating how? Let's separate two components. \n",
    "\n",
    "The first component is *structure*. In a horizontal gambling problem, an infinite sequence of people each face a gamble in turn, have the same initial bankroll, and everyone has to bet the same amount. In a vertical gambling problem, you face a gamble repeatedly, your bankroll rolls over, and you have to bet the same proportion every time. These descriptions fix the structure of horizontal and vertical gambling problems. In general, to describe the structure is to describe what the bettors *do*.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second component is the *performance measure*. In horizontal gambling problems, the performance measure is the average bankroll. In vertical gambling problems, the performance measure is the growth rate. In general, the performance measure is the criterion by which we judge when this bettor, or group of bettors, outperforms that bettor, or group of bettors. (Don't confuse the performance measure with the bettors' utility functions, which do a quite different job.)\n",
    "\n",

    "What we care about is when one bettor or group of bettors has more money than another bettor or group of bettors after $n$ rounds. In a horizontal gambling problem, this group has more money than that group after $n$ rounds just if this group's total bankroll after $n$ rounds is greater than that group's total bankroll after $n$ rounds, which holds just if this group's average bankroll after $n$ rounds is greater than that group's average bankroll after $n$ rounds. That's why looking at average rather than total bankroll is harmless: it doesn't change how we compare groups. (It might change how we compare groups after different numbers of rounds, but we're only interested in comparing groups after the same number of rounds.) And it happens that the average is easier to work with than the total. Using the average makes it easy to apply the Laws of Large Numbers, and so to compare how groups do as the number of rounds tends to infinity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, in a vertical gambling problem, this bettor has more money than that bettor after $n$ rounds just if this bettor's final bankroll after $n$ rounds is greater than that bettor's final bankroll after $n$ rounds, which holds just if this bettor's growth rate after $n$ rounds is greater than that bettor's growth rate after $n$ rounds. That's why looking at growth rate rather than final bankroll is harmless: it doesn't change how we compare bettors. (It might change how we compare bettors after different numbers of rounds, but we're only interested in comparing bettors after the same number of rounds.) And it happens that the growth rate is easier to work with than the final bankroll. Using the growth rate makes it easy to apply the Laws of Large Numbers, and so to compare how bettors do as the number of rounds tends to infinity.\n",

    "Let's say  performance measure *respects what we care about* just in case: if the total of these bettors' final bankrolls after $n$ rounds is greater than the total of those bettors' final bankrolls after $n$ rounds, then the performance measure should return a higher value for these bettors than those bettors.\n",
    "\n",
    "To summarize. The basic performance measure is how much money a bettor, or group of bettors, has: total bankroll in the horizontal case; final bankroll in the vertical case. But we only care about *comparing* groups after the *same* number of rounds: when one bettor or group of bettors has more money after $n$ rounds than another bettor or group of bettors has after $n$ rounds. Because we only care about comparisons after the same number of rounds, it's harmless to look not at quantity of money but at average bankroll in the horizontal case or growth rate in the vertical case, since these performance measures resepct what we care about. And looking at average or growth rate is helpful, since they make the analysis easier: they make it easy to apply the Laws of Large Numbers, and so to compare how groups do as the number of rounds tends to infinity.\n",
    "\n",
    "We're going to consider some other betting structures, which will involve both horizontal and vertical betting. As before, what we care about is when one group has more money than another after $n$ rounds. No matter the structure, this group has more money than that group after $n$ rounds just if the total final bankrolls in this group after $n$ rounds is greater than the total final bankrolls in that group after $n$ rounds. But instead of focusing on the total final bankrolls, we can focus on some other performance measure, as long as it respects what we care about. If that performance measure also makes the analysis easier, all the better.\n",
    "\n",
    "An example. Look not at the total of the final bankrolls---the basic performance measure---but at (total of final bankrolls) divided by (1 + total of final bankrolls). Because the function, viewed as a function of total of final bankrolls, is strictly monotone increasing, it doesn't make a difference to what we care about. (Note that, unlike the average and growth rate, functions of this form don't take the number of the round as an argument. So functions of this form don't change how we compare bettors after *different* numbers of rounds, as well as after the *same* number of rounds. But since we're only interested in comparing bettors after the same number of rounds, this property is irrelevant.)\n",
    "\n",
    "There's no need to settle on a single performance measure. When we change the betting structure, we can change the performance measure too if it helps with the analysis. All that matters is that the performance measure respects what we care about: if the total of these bettors' final bankrolls after $n$ rounds is greater than the total of those bettors' final bankrolls after $n$ rounds, then the performance measure should return a higher value for these bettors than those bettors."

So, for example, MEV does better than MEGR across horizontal iterations, and in fact does best, and MEGR does better than MEV across vertical iterations, and in fact does best.
