    "In an *n by 2 gambling problem*, two people, $A_1$ and $A_2$, face gambling problems with win probability $p$ and odds $b$:1 each day. Each of their bankrolls before betting on Day 1 is $r$. And their bankrolls roll over: each persons' bankroll before betting on Day $k+1$ is whatever her bankroll after betting is on Day $k$. They have to bet the same proportion of their bankrolls each day, and as each other. The outcomes of their gambles are independent.\n",

    "Take Example 1 above, where $p=\\frac{1}{2}$, $b=2$ and $r$ is 100 dollars. Suppose each day they both bet proportion $m$, for some $m \\in [0,1]$. What will happen? Here's one way things might go. On Day 1, $A_1$ bets and wins and $A_2$ bets and loses, say. $A_1$ now has $100(1+bm)$ dollars and $A_2$ has $100(1-m)$ dollars. Their combined bankroll is $100(2+(b-1)m)$. On Day 2, both bet and lose, say. $A_1$ now has $100(1+bm)(1-m)$ dollars and $A_2$ now has $100(1-m)^2$ dollars. Their combined bankroll is $100(1-m)(2+(b-1)m)$ dollars. And so on. We're interested in their combined bankroll as they bet more and more times. \n",

Well, if their final bankrolls after betting $n$ times with initial bankroll $r$ are $f_1$ and $f_2$, then their average growth rate is $g = \\frac{1}{2} \\big( \\sqrt[n]{\\frac{f_1}{r}} + \\sqrt[n]{\\frac{f_2}{r}} \\big)$.\n",
