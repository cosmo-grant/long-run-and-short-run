Or I might have chosen them by flicking through Stephen Abbott's textbook *Understanding Analysis* until two sequences caught my eye.

So the deductivist concludes that none of the conditions in the table is evidence either way and you should put *coin* in every cell. The Bayesian says that *E* is evidence for *H* when *P(H | E) > P(H)*.

Or if you know that $x_n \\to 0$ and $y_n \\to \\infty$, then by guessing $x_k$ every time you're guaranteed eventually to keep guessing correctly.

The *edge* of a gamble is the expected net winnings on a 1 dollar bet, which is $pb - (1-p)$. This is just the expected value of betting 1 dollar, but taking your initial bankroll as the baseline, rather than 0 dollars. In other words, it's the expected *change* in value of betting 1 dollar. The edge equals $p(b+1)-1$, which expression we saw earlier: it's the gradient of the line of expected value against amount bet.\n",
    "\n",
    "MEGR advises you to bet the proportion of your bankroll given by *edge over odds*:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\frac{pb - (1-p)}{b} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "The odds of a gamble $b$ is the net winnings on a 1 dollar bet if you win. So yet another way to put MEGR's advice is to bet expected net winnings over net winnings if you win, on a 1 dollar bet. Or more simply, since the bet size will cancel out, expected net winnings over net winnings if you win.\n",
    "\n",
    "That's how I worked out what MEGR recommends in Examples 1 and 2. In Example 1 the edge is $\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 2 - \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{2}$ and the odds are 2:1, so edge over odds is 0.25. In Example 2, the edge is $\\frac{2}{3} - \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{1}{3}$ and the odds are 1:1, so edge over odds is $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "A corner case: when $p(b+1)-1 < 0$, the edge is negative, so edge over odds is negative. In that case, the proportion $m \\in [0,1]$ which maximizes expected growth rate is 0, so that's the proportion which MEGR recommends."

    "\n",
    "Take Example 1 above, where $p=\\frac{1}{2}$, $b=2$ and $r$ is 100 dollars. Suppose everyone bets $m$ dollars, for some $m \\in [0,100]$. What will happen? Here's one way things might go. First, $A_1$ bets and wins, say, giving her $100 + 2m$ dollars. That is her bankroll after betting. Then $A_2$ bets and loses, say, giving her $100-m$ dollars. The bankrolls of $A_1$ and $A_2$ after betting total $200 + m$ dollars. Then $A_3$ bets and wins, say, giving her $100 + 2m$ dollars. The bankrolls of $A_1$, $A_2$, $A_3$ after betting total $300 + 3m$ dollars. And so on. We're interested in the bettors' total bankroll after betting, as more and more people bet.\n",
    "\n",
    "It turns out that it's more convenient to proceed indirectly, by looking not at the bettors' *total* bankroll $t$ but at their *average* bankroll $\\frac{t}{n}$, where $n$ is the number of people who have bet. Given $n$, the two come to the same thing: either determines the other. The higher the total, the higher the average; the higher the average, the higher the total. Looking at the average bankroll rather than total bankroll happens to be more convenient, because the average bankroll is bounded and the total bankroll isn't. But the change is just a change in point of view. It's like changing the scale in which we measure the total bankroll. See Section TBD for further discussion. \n",
    "\n",
    "In general, each time someone wins, her resulting bankroll is $r+bm$ dollars and each time someone loses, her resulting bankroll is $r-m$ dollars. So if $A_1$, ..., $A_n$ bet and exactly $k$ of them win, then their total bankroll is:\n",

    "You can evaluate these expressions, the total bankroll and average bankroll after $k$ wins in $n$ bets, for different values for $n$, $k$, $b$, and $m$ using the sliders below. It assumes the initial bankroll $r$ is 100 dollars."

    "MEGR does best in the long-run. Let's unpack what that means.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a *vertical gambling problem*, you face a gambling problem with win probability $p$ and odds $b$:1 each day. Your bankroll before betting on Day 1 is $r$. And it rolls over: your bankroll before betting on Day $n+1$ is whatever your bankroll after betting is on Day $n$. You have to bet the same proportion of your bankroll each day.\n",
    "\n",
    "Take Example 1 above, where $p=\\frac{1}{2}$, $b=2$ and $r$ is 100 dollars. Suppose each day you bet proportion $m$, for some $m \\in [0,1]$. What will happen? Here's one way things might go. On Day 1, you bet and win, say. You now have $100(1+bm)$ dollars. (Why? Because you had 100 dollars, bet $100m$ dollars, and got back your bet plus $b$ times your bet.) On Day 2, you bet and lose, say. You now have $100(1+bm)(1-m)$ dollars. (Why? Because you had $100(1+bm)$ dollars, bet $100(1+bm)m$ dollars, and lost it.) On Day 3, you bet and win, say. You now have $100(1+bm)(1-m)(1+bm)$ dollars. (Why? Because you had $100(1+bm)(1-m)$ dollars, bet $100(1+bm)(1-m)m$ dollars and got back your bet plus $b$ times your bet.) And so on. We're interested in your final bankroll as you bet more and more times. \n",
    "\n",
    "It turns out that it's more convenient to proceed indirectly, by looking not at your final bankroll but at your bankroll's *growth rate*. What's that? Well, if your final bankroll after betting $n$ times with initial bankroll $r$ is $f$, then your bankroll's growth rate is $g = \\sqrt[n]{\\frac{f}{r}}$. If you multiply your initial bankroll $r$ by the growth rate $g$ each day $n$ times, once for each time you bet, then you get your final bankroll.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ r \\cdot g^n = r \\cdot \\frac{f}{r} = f $$\n",
    "\n",
    "The growth rate, then, may be viewed as the rate of compound daily interest required to yield $f$ from $r$ in $n$ days. \n",
    "\n",
    "Given your initial bankroll $r$ and the number of bets $n$, your final bankroll comes to the same thing as the growth rate: either determines the other. Given $f$, we have $g = \\sqrt[n]{\\frac{f}{r}}$; and given $g$, we have $f = r \\cdot g^n$. The higher the final bankroll, the higher the growth rate; the higher the growth rate, the higher the final bankroll. Looking at growth rate rather than final bankroll happens to be more convenient, because the growth rate is bounded and the final bankroll isn't. But the change is just a change in point of view. It's a bit like changing the scale in which we measure your final bankroll. See Section TBD for further discussion.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each time you win in a vertical gambling problem, you multiply your bankroll by $(1+bm)$ and each time you lose, you multiply your bankroll by $(1-m)$. So if your initial bankroll is $r$ dollars, you bet $n$ times and win $k$ times, your final bankroll is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ r \\cdot (1+bm)^k \\cdot (1-m)^{n-k} $$\n",

    "And the growth rate is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ (1+bm)^{\\frac{k}{n}} \\cdot (1-m)^{\\frac{n-k}{n}} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "You can evaluate these two expressions, your final bankroll and the growth rate after $k$ wins in $n$ bets, for different values for $n$, $k$, $b$, and $m$ using the sliders below. When calculating your final bankroll, we assume your initial bankroll $r$ is 100 dollars."

If one MEGR-bettor bets many times, she'll do better by the end than any rival, including MEV-bettors. MEGR is the *sustainable* choice. It's common to defend MEV by pointing out that it does best in the long-run. (It's one of the two defenses [R. A. Briggs](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/rationality-normative-utility/#LonRunArg) describes in her survey about MEV.)

We need to make clear how we *project* behaviour in a one-off gambling problem to behaviour in a repeated gambling problem. \n",

These different parameterizations suggest different projections: bet the same amount or bet the same proportion.\n",

In particular, MEGR-bettors in horizontal gambling problems bet the same amount every time. As it happens, in a horizontal gambling problem, betting the same amount comes to the same thing as betting the same proportion, since all the bettors' initial bankrolls are equal.\n",

In a vertical gambling problem, one person bets many times, she bets the same proportion every time, and we look at her final bankroll, or actually, since it turns out to be more convenient, the growth rate. Of course, we could just as well say that in a horizontal gambling problem, one person bets many times, as long as we add that her bankroll resets every time, and that in a vertical gambling problem, many people bet once, as long as we add that each bettor's bankroll after betting becomes the next bettor's bankroll before betting. What matters is how the bankroll changes from bet to bet, not the number of bettors or how many times each of them bets. Contrasting many people betting once and one person betting many times just makes things easier to say."

    "#### How to iterate a decision problem?\n",
    "\n",
    "We generate a vertical or horizontal gambling problem from a one-off gambling problem by iterating the one-off problem. Iterating how? Let's separate two components. \n",
    "\n",
    "The first component is *structure*. In a horizontal gambling problem, an infinite sequence of people each face a gamble in turn, have the same initial bankroll, and everyone has to bet the same amount. In a vertical gambling problem, you face a gamble repeatedly, your bankroll rolls over, and you have to bet the same proportion every time. These descriptions fix the structure of horizontal and vertical gambling problems. In general, to describe the structure is to describe what the bettors *do*.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second component is the *performance measure*. In horizontal gambling problems, the performance measure is the total bankroll, or, which comes to the same thing, average bankroll. In vertical gambling problems, the performance measure is the final bankroll, or, which comes to the same thing, the growth rate. In general, the performance measure is the criterion by which you judge when this bettor, or group of bettors, outperforms that bettor, or group of bettors. (Don't confuse the performance measure with the bettors' utility functions, which do a quite different job. I discuss utility functions later in this section.)\n",
    "\n",
    "The two components, structure and performance measure, together describe how to iterate a one-off gambling problem. The discussion has focused on two ways to iterate one-off problems. Let's consider others.\n",
    "\n",
    "We could change the performance measure. Instead of using average bankroll in a horizontal gambling problem, we could use: the average of the squares, the average of the cube roots, the geometric or harmonic average, some function which combines average and variance. And so on. Instead of using growth rate in a vertical gambling problem, we could use: the growth rate of the logs, the growth rate of the ceilings, the minimum or maximum growth rate across bets, some function which combines growth rate and median. And so on. The options are endless. Some choices of performance measure won't change the analysis. They're changes of scale, like moving from total bankroll and final bankroll to average bankroll and growth rate. Other choices will change the analysis. Using average bankroll and growth rate is hardly arbitrary, but perhaps other options have equal claim and would yield different results.\n",
    "\n",
    "We could change the structure. Example: Imagine two bettors, $A$ and $B$, who each face a gambling problem with win probability $p$ and odds $b$:1 repeatedly. Each of their bankrolls before betting on Day 1 is $r$. After betting each day, they pool and divide their bankrolls, to give each their initial bankroll for the next day. They have to bet the same proportion each day and the same proportion as each other. The structure is a mix of the vertical and the horizontal: it involves two people each facing a vertical gambling problem, but with an additional step where their bankrolls are averaged after betting each day. What does best in this iterated gambling problem: what MEV recommends in the one-off gambling problem, what MEGR recommends in the one-off gambling problem, or something else? Of course, that's merely one example. The options are endless. \n",
    "\n",
    "When we iterate a gambling problem horizontally, what MEV recommends in the one-off problem does best. That is a long-run justification for MEV. When we iterate a gambling problem vertically, what MEGR recommends in the one-off problem does best. That is a long-run justification for MEGR. Conjecture: For most recommendations in one-off gambling problems, there is a way to iterate the one-off problem such that that recommendation does best. Most decision rules have a long-run justification. Long-run justifications of decision rules are cheap.\n",
    "\n",
    "To resolve the conjecture, think up ways to iterate one-off gambling problems, analyze them as in Sections 4.5 and 4.6, then reverse-engineer decision rules which are vindicated by the analyses. That's what I'll work on next."

Therefore MEV's advice---choose an action which maximizes expected value---is well-defined in all decision problems, not just gambling problems. MEGR's advice---choose an action which maximizes expected growth rate---is well-defined in *some* other decision problems, such as betting on gambles with multiple mutually exclusive outcomes, rather than just two outcomes. But it's not well-defined in all decision problems. For it to be well-defined, the actions and outcomes must lie on the same scale, roughly speaking. It would be nice to find a generalization of MEGR's advice which does apply across all decision problems. We might start on that problem by characterizing precisely when MEGR's advice is well-defined."

    "Whether 1 supports 2 is similar, but note two differences. First, it's not true that MEV-bettors eventually *are* ahead of rival bettors; what is true is that MEV-bettors eventually *tend* to be ahead of rival bettors. 1 is probabilistic, not categorical. By contrast, 7 is categorical, not probabilistic. (But both are long-run.) Second, 8 is about particular members of the sequences, the 100$^{th}$ members. 2 isn't. Compare 2 to \"People in a horizontal gambling problem who bet the MEV amount tend to be ahead of people who don't after 100 bets.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "We might try to get from 1 to 2 via a principle like this: Option X is better than Option Y if someone who does X is more likely than not to end up ahead of someone who does Y. Applying the principle to horizontal gambling problems is tricky, since it's not clear what *ends up* means when the number of bets is unbounded. But anyway surely the principle is false. Consider one-off gambling problems: when $p < \\frac{1}{2}$, someone who bets nothing is more likely than not to end up ahead of someone who bets something; when $p > \\frac{1}{2}$, someone who bets something is more likely than not to end up ahead of someone who bets nothing. It doesn't follow that when $p < \\frac{1}{2}$ betting nothing is better than betting something or when $p > \\frac{1}{2}$ betting something is better than betting nothing. So even if the principle did apply neatly to horizontal gambling problems, it's false anyway.\n",

    "*Does 2 support 3?* It's a bad strategy, in general, to evaluate a recommendation in one decision problem by seeing how that recommendation does in another decision problem. For one thing, the strategy just replaces one evaluation task (evaluate the recommendation in *this* decision problem) with another (evaluate the recommendation in *that* decision problem). When the second evaluation task is easier than the first, this may constitute progress; but when it isn't, it doesn't. For another thing, why should we evaluate a recommendation in one decision problem by seeing how it does in another? We don't evaluate weightlifters by seeing how they do in the pole-vault. To use 2 to support 3 is to evaluate recommendations in one decision problem, a gambling problem, by seeing how they do in another, a horizontal gambling problem. If the strategy is bad in general, is it any better in this particular case?\n",
    "\n",
    "To support the first point, earlier in the section I suggested that it's not straightforward to evaluate MEV's recommendation in horizontal gambling problems. On the second point, standard objections to evaluating MEV's recommendation in a gambling problem by seeing how it does in a horizontal gambling problem are that no decision *will* be repeated indefinitely, most *won't* even be repeated often, some *can't* be repeated often, and even those which *will* be repeated are not independent. To these we can add: if you should bet the MEV amount in a horizontal gambling problem, then you should bet the MEGR proportion in a vertical gambling problem; but MEV and MEGR disagree in one-off gambling problems.\n",

    "To spell out the last point in full: If 2 is true then 5 is true. If (if 2 is true then 3 is true) then (if 5 is true then 6 is true). Either 3 is false or 6 is false. So, 2 is false. And by a similar argument, 5 is false.\n",

    "*Does 1 support 3?* 1 is two long-runs away from 3, when you go via 2, for 1 is a long-run away from 2 and 2 is a long-run away from 3. I doubt whether 1 supports 2 or 2 supports 3. So I doubt whether 1 supports 3 via 2. 1 might support 3 not via 2. But I'm skeptical."

They disagree. And similarly in other gambling problems.

That's the easy part. The hard part is to adjust the definitions of horizontal and vertical gambling problems. As things stand, the long-run results above won't in general hold when $u$ is non-linear. (Imagine what happens when $u$ is bounded or non-increasing.)
