    "Population growth is analogous to capital growth. We can apply results from one to the other.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, take the model of population growth in Section 1.1. The model has one parameter: the distribution of the growth rate $l_t$. A bettor in a vertical gambling problem is characterized by three parameters: the win probability $p$, the payoff odds $b$:1 and her bet proportion $m$. We'd like some way to convert one model to the other: given parameters from one model, come up with parameters for the other, such that population growth coincides with capital growth under these parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example. Assume that $l_t$, the growth rate, takes exactly two values, $l^+ > 1$ with probability $q$ and $l^- < 1$ with probability $1-q$. We'd like to come up with parameters $p$, $b$, and $m$ such that the population growth under $l_t$ coincides with capital growth under $p$, $b$ and $m$.\n",
    "\n",
    "How? Well, when the gambler loses, which happens with probability $1-p$, her bankroll is multiplied by $1-m$ and in a bad year, which happens with probability $1-q$, the population is multiplied by $l^-$. Setting these equal gives $p=q$ and $m = 1-l^-$. When the gambler wins, her bankroll is multiplied by $1+bm = 1+b(1-l^-)$ and in a good year the population is multiplied by $l^+$. Setting these equal gives $b = \\frac{l^+ -1}{1-l^-}$. We've now come up with parameters $p$, $b$ and $m$ such that population growth under $l_i$ coincides with capital growth under $p$, $b$, and $m$, as desired.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can then apply results from one field to the other. For example, let $X$ be the random variable representing the growth of the bankroll. So $X$ is $(1+bm)$ with probability $p$ and $(1-m)$ with probability $1-p$. The arithmetic mean of $X$ is $p \\cdot (1+bm) + (1-p) \\cdot (1-m)$, which is $m \\big( p(b+1)-1 \\big) + 1$, or 1 plus $m$ times the edge. Thus:\n",

    "> Assuming $m>0$, if the edge is positive, the capital expectations tend to infinity and if the edge is negative, the capital expectations tends to 0.\n",

Since the expected number of offspring per capita is the same, after $n$ years the expected number of animals using A equals the expected number using B, namely $N_0 \\cdot 1.1^n$. Perhaps it follows that we shouldn't expect either strategy to come to dominate the population.\n",

If $k$ is large enough compared to $n$, there'll be more animals using B than A; if not, there'll be more animals using A than B. As $n$ gets larger, it'll tend to happen that about half of the years are good and about half are bad, in which case there'll be more animals using A than B. A will probably come to dominate the population, and as $n$ gets larger, that becomes more and more likely.\n",

The actual growth rate is the rate of yearly growth which delivers the final population after $k$ good years in $n$ from the initial population. The higher the actual growth rate, the higher the final population. The Weak Law of Large Numbers tells us that:\n",

    "Are strategies in a population growth problem analogous to bet proportions in a vertical gambling problem? No. Recall the translation above: it takes a distribution over the growth rate, i.e. a strategy in a population growth problem, and returns $p$, $b$, and $m$ such that the population growth of the strategy in the population growth problem coincides with capital growth in a vertical gambling problem under $p$, $b$ and $m$. The trouble is that the different strategies in a population growth problem will typically map to different values of $p$ and $b$. So different strategies in a population growth problem will typically map, not just to different bet proportions in a *single* vertical gambling problem (same $p$, $b$; different $m$), but to different bet proportions in *different* vertical gambling problems (different $p$, $b$, $m$). So thinking about rival strategies in a particular population growth problem is not the same as thinking about rival bet proportions in a particular vertical gambling problem. That's not to say that the two problems---population growth and capital growth---don't shed light on each other, just that the flat-footed translation from one to the other doesn't work."
